	<h1> Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
	<p>In this lab, we experimented with functions in Javascript. </p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> We had no difficulties doing the required tasks of the lab, but we
	struggled while trying to figure out some of the bonus tasks. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> Here are the results of the Javascript file. We were able to prompt user
	input outside of our name sorting function. We also added text if you hit
	cancel on the prompt or entered no text. </p>
	 <h3> Script Output </h3>
