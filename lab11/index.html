			<h1> Challenges </h1>
			<p> One challenge we faced came from task 3 about the special class.
				We were able to toggle the special class with our button by creating the
				class beforehand in the css. We weren't sure if we were also supposed
				to create the special class with jQuery in the JS file.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="problems">
			<h1> Problems </h1>
			<p> We had a problem with assigning the special class with a button click.
				It turned out to be just a syntax error :D </p>
		</div>
		<div id="results">
			<h1> Results </h1>
			<p> The results can be seen by pressing all of the buttons! </p>
