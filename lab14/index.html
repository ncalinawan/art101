			<h1> Challenges </h1>
			<p> All of our labs worked as intended without bugs! We ran the
				debugger on the last lab anyway to see what was happening within
				the function. </p>

		<div id="problems">
			<h1> Problems </h1>
			<p> Our debugger only started showing values at 105 in our FizzBuzzBoom
				function. We found out that this was because of where we placed the
				debugger line in our code.</p>
