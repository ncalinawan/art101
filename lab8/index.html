		<h1> Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
		<p>In this lab, we worked with anon functions and callbacks. </p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> The function lab itself was pretty self-explanatory, but we struggled to do some of the bonus tasks. Wes wasn't kidding, it wasn't easy at all. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> We got the functions to work as intended. Check out the console for the results. </p>
