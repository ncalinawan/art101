			<h1> Challenges </h1>
			<p> We were able to get the loop figured out pretty easily, but we aren't
				sure if we did it efficiently. (but it works!) We also had trouble
				making the function output the correct things."</p>

		<div id="problems">
			<h1> Problems </h1>
			<p> We ran into a few problems. The first was that our first result in
			#output was undefined. This was because we declared our str variable
			without setting it to anything. The only bonus we tried was styling
			our output in columns, but we were unable to do so.</p>

			<h1> Results </h1>
			<p> Results can be seen below as well as in the console.</p>
