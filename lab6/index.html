	<p>In this lab, we experimented with arrays and objects in Javascript. </p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> This time, we tried tackling the image problem from the last lab again. </p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> We still had a problem moving our image to the right of our text, but we later found it was a syntax error.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> We FINALLY got it after experimenting for a few minutes. Cheers all around. We would like to thank w3schools for supporting us through these difficult times. </p>
