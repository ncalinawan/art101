		<h1> Lab 10 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> Most of the challenge this lab was from us figuring out how to put the form in the box and also how to do some of the bonus tasks. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> We were successful... somewhat. We got the box and we managed to do an anagram, but we still can't figure out how to capitalize the first letter. Try submitting a blank form and see what happens! :D</p>
